# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

My motivation to creating this project was to provide myself and others with an adequate study space. I built this project to gain knowledge of language used within the Prework. By creating this project it solves the problem of having little to no knowledge of how to use these languages. I learned not only how to create this webpage but also the ins and outs of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript
